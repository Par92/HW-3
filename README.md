Password Generator
- Modified given starter code in order to create an application that generates a random password.
- Gave the user several options of criteria to include in the generated password.
- The password must include a minimum length of 8 characters, and a maximum of 128 characters. It also must include at least one of the offered criteria. 
- If the user does not select correctly, i have given an error message and the series of prompts starts over.
- Then a password is generated and the and displayed on the page.
- Technique I used was to create an array for each of the possible criteria, and then once the options were confirmed I made use of the "concat" prototype to make a new array which I titled "bank." From this bank I used a loop to select at random to form the password.
